# Specification Framework for ARM Verification

This file defines the specification framework for verifying ARM programs,
following the relational Hoare logic approach from s2n-bignum.

The framework is organized following the article "Relational Hoare Logic for
Realistically Modelled Machine Code" (CAV 2025):

## Unary Hoare Logic L₁

* `eventually step P s` - Reachability predicate (operational semantics)
* `ensures step pre post frame` - Hoare triple with frame condition

## Relational Logic L₂ (for future extension)

* `eventuallyn` - Eventually with explicit step count
* `ensuresn` - Stronger ensures with step function
* `ensures2` - Relational Hoare triple for two programs

## Frame Conditions

* `maychange_regs` - MAYCHANGE for registers
* `maychange_mem` - MAYCHANGE for memory

## Operational Semantics - Eventually

`eventually step P s` holds if predicate `P` is reachable from state `s` through
the transition relation `step`.

The two inference rules:
1. **base**: If `P s` already holds, then `eventually step P s`
2. **step**: If there exists a next state AND all next states satisfy
   `eventually step P`, then `eventually step P s`
-/

/--
Reachability predicate: `eventually step P s` holds if `P` is reachable from `s`
via the transition relation `step`.
-/
inductive eventually (step : α → α → Prop) (P : α → Prop) : α → Prop where
  | base : P s → eventually step P s
  | ind (h₁ : ∃ s', step s s') (h₂ : ∀ s', step s s' → eventually step P s')
    : eventually step P s

/-!
## Hoare Triple - Ensures

The `ensures` predicate defines Hoare triples with frame conditions:

> "If precondition `P` holds in state `s`, then following the operational
> semantics (`step`), we **eventually** reach a state `s'` where:
> - The postcondition `Q s'` holds
> - The frame `C s s'` holds (only allowed components changed)"

This corresponds to the axiomatic semantics (Hoare logic) built ON TOP of the
operational semantics (`eventually`).
-/

/--
`ensures step pre post frame` is the formal specification that from any state
satisfying `pre`, we eventually reach a state satisfying `post ∧ frame`.
-/
def ensures (step : α → α → Prop) (pre post : α → Prop)
  (frame : α → α → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ s, pre s → eventually step (fun s' => post s' ∧ frame s s') s

## Relational Composition

We use Mathlib's `Relation.Comp` for frame composition, which corresponds to
HOL Light's `,,` operator from s2n-bignum/common/relational.ml:26-27:

/--
Simplified transitivity when frames are idempotent under relational composition
(C ,, C = C).

This holds for MAYCHANGE-style frames where `C s s'` means "only certain
components may differ between s and s'". Such frames are idempotent because if
only certain components may change from s to s₁, and only those same components
may change from s₁ to s', then only those components may change from s to s'.

## ARM Step Relation

The `arm` step relation defines single-instruction execution using fetch-decode-
execute from memory, matching HOL Light's architecture where programs live in
memory rather than as a separate structure.
-/

/--
ARM single-step relation: `arm s s'` holds if `s'` is the result of executing
one instruction from state `s`.

This corresponds to HOL Light's `arm` step relation. The execution:
1. Reads the PC
2. Fetches and decodes the instruction at PC from memory
3. Executes the instruction
4. Advances the PC (handled by `step`)

This definition keeps programs in memory, matching the paper's model where
the machine state includes both data and code memory.
-/
def arm (s s' : ArmState) : Prop :=
  let pc := s.read_reg Reg.PC
  match arm_decode s pc with
  | some instr => s' = step instr s
  | none => False

/--
A program (as machine code bytes) is loaded at the given base address.

This corresponds to HOL Light's `aligned_bytes_loaded` combined with a PC check.
Used in preconditions to assert that the program bytes are in memory.
-/
def program_loaded (s : ArmState) (base : Word64) (mc : List UInt8) : Prop :=
  aligned_bytes_loaded s.mem base mc ∧
  s.read_reg Reg.PC = base

/--
Alternative: program bytes loaded without PC constraint.
-/
def program_bytes_loaded (s : ArmState) (base : Word64) (mc : List UInt8) : Prop :=
  aligned_bytes_loaded s.mem base mc

/--
Convenience: `ensures_arm` specialized to the ARM step relation.

This is the primary interface for ARM program verification:
```lean
ensures_arm
  (fun s => program_loaded s base mc ∧ ...)  -- precondition
  (fun s => s.read_reg Reg.PC = ... ∧ ...)   -- postcondition
  (maychange_regs [Reg.PC, ...])             -- frame
```
-/
abbrev ensures_arm := ensures arm

## Computational Bridge: exec → ensures

The key insight from the INSTRUCTION.md document: `exec` is a **real function**
that Lean can compute. We don't need to manually apply `eventually.ind` for each
instruction step — we can work with the computed final state directly.

The bridge theorems here connect:
1. `arm_decode_list`: a decidable Prop that each instruction decodes correctly
   from the sequence of states produced by `exec`
2. `eventually_exec`: the computed state is reachable via `eventually arm`
3. `ensures_of_exec`: the main bridge reducing `ensures` to properties of `exec`

This is the Lean analogue of HOL Light's ARM_STEPS_TAC: instead of manually
stepping through instructions, we reduce the proof obligation to facts about
the computed final state.
-/

/--
`arm_decode_list instrs s` holds when each instruction in `instrs` is correctly
decoded from the sequence of states produced by executing them from `s`.

The intermediate states are **computed** (via `step`), not existentially
quantified. This makes the predicate decidable for concrete byte sequences.
-/
def arm_decode_list : List Instruction → ArmState → Prop
  | [],            _ => True
  | instr :: rest, s =>
    arm_decode s (s.read_reg Reg.PC) = some instr ∧
    arm_decode_list rest (step instr s)

/--
If `arm_decode_list` holds, then `eventually arm` reaches `exec instrs s`.
-/
theorem eventually_exec (instrs : List Instruction) (s : ArmState)
    (h : arm_decode_list instrs s) :
    eventually arm (· = exec instrs s) s := by
  induction instrs generalizing s with
  | nil =>
    exact eventually.base rfl
  | cons instr rest ih =>
    obtain ⟨hdec, hrest⟩ := h
    apply eventually.ind
    · exact ⟨step instr s, by unfold arm; simp [hdec]⟩
    · intro s' hs'
      unfold arm at hs'
      simp only [hdec] at hs'
      subst hs'
      exact eventually_mono (fun s'' heq => by simp [exec, heq]) _ (ih _ hrest)

/--
The main bridge: reduce `ensures arm` to properties of the computed final state.

Instead of manually applying `eventually.ind` for each instruction, prove:
1. The instructions decode correctly (`arm_decode_list`)
2. The postcondition holds on `exec instrs s`
3. The frame condition holds between `s` and `exec instrs s`
-/
theorem ensures_of_exec
    (instrs : List Instruction)
    {pre post : ArmState → Prop} {frame : ArmState → ArmState → Prop}
    (h_decode : ∀ s, pre s → arm_decode_list instrs s)
    (h_post : ∀ s, pre s → post (exec instrs s))
    (h_frame : ∀ s, pre s → frame s (exec instrs s)) :
    ensures arm pre post frame := by
  intro s hpre
  have hev := eventually_exec instrs s (h_decode s hpre)
  exact eventually_mono (fun s' heq => heq ▸ ⟨h_post s hpre, h_frame s hpre⟩) s hev


/--
If the bytes at each instruction offset decode to the expected instructions,
and the bytes are loaded in memory, then `arm_decode_list` holds for the given
instruction list and a state whose PC points to the base.

This is the lemma that bridges `aligned_bytes_loaded` (from preconditions)
to `arm_decode_list` (needed by `ensures_of_exec`). It lets you prove
`arm_decode_list` in a proof by providing individual `exec_at`-style facts.

For concrete byte lists (like `simple_mc`), the individual decode hypotheses
are closed by `by decide`.
-/
theorem arm_decode_list_cons (instr : Instruction) (rest : List Instruction)
    (s : ArmState)
    (h_head : arm_decode s (s.read_reg Reg.PC) = some instr)
    (h_tail : arm_decode_list rest (step instr s)) :
    arm_decode_list (instr :: rest) s :=
  ⟨h_head, h_tail⟩

/-!
## Frame Conditions (MAYCHANGE)

Frame conditions specify which components of the state MAY change during
program execution. Everything not in the frame must remain unchanged.

source: s2n-bignum/common/relational.ml

In HOL Light, `ASSIGNS` and `MAYCHANGE` have the following semantics:

```ocaml
(* ASSIGNS c s s' means: there exists some value y such that s' = write c y s *)
(* i.e., s' differs from s only in component c *)
ASSIGNS (c:(A,B)component) s s' <=> exists y. (c := y) s s'

(* MAYCHANGE is relational composition of ASSIGNS *)
MAYCHANGE [] = (=)   (* equality relation: nothing changes *)
MAYCHANGE (CONS c cs) = ASSIGNS c ,, MAYCHANGE cs
```

For example: `MAYCHANGE [PC; X2]` = `ASSIGNS PC ,, ASSIGNS X2`

The key insight is that `ASSIGNS c` is **trivially satisfiable** for any two
states (we can always choose `y = read c s'`). The real constraint comes from
the composition: if only components in the list may change, then all other
components must remain equal.

We use a simplified but equivalent formulation:
- `unchanged_reg r s₁ s₂`: register r has the same value in both states
- `maychange_regs regs s₁ s₂`: all registers NOT in regs are unchanged

**Constructive vs Observational equivalence**: HOL Light's `ASSIGNS c s s'` is
*constructive*: it asserts `s' = write c y s` for some `y`. Our formulation is
*observational*: it only asserts equality of values. These are equivalent when
`write` is "pure" (only affects the target component) and the state has no
hidden fields.
-/

/--
A register must not change between two states.
-/
def unchanged_reg (r : Reg) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  s₁.read_reg r = s₂.read_reg r

/--
Memory at an address must not change.
-/
def unchanged_mem (addr : Address) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  s₁.read_mem_byte addr = s₂.read_mem_byte addr

/--
All flags must not change between two states.
-/
def unchanged_flags (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  s₁.flags = s₂.flags

/--
An individual flag must not change between two states.
-/
def unchanged_flag (f : Flag) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  s₁.read_flag f = s₂.read_flag f

/--
`maychange_regs regs s₁ s₂` holds when all registers NOT in `regs` are
unchanged. This is equivalent to HOL Light's `MAYCHANGE [r1; r2; ...]` for
registers: the registers in the list MAY change (no constraint), while all
others must remain equal.

Source: s2n-bignum/common/relational.ml
-/
def maychange_regs (regs : List Reg) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  ∀ r, r ∉ regs → unchanged_reg r s₁ s₂

/--
`maychange_mem addrs s₁ s₂` holds when all memory addresses NOT in `addrs` are
unchanged.
-/
def maychange_mem (addrs : List Address) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  ∀ a, a ∉ addrs → unchanged_mem a s₁ s₂

/--
`maychange_flags flags s₁ s₂` holds when all flags NOT in `flags` are unchanged.

This allows fine-grained control like `MAYCHANGE [CF; ZF]` in HOL Light.

Source: s2n-bignum/arm/proofs/instruction.ml:186-192
-/
def maychange_flags (flags : List Flag) (s₁ s₂ : ArmState) : Prop :=
  ∀ f, f ∉ flags → unchanged_flag f s₁ s₂

/--
Combine frame conditions via conjunction.

When we have `maychange_regs regs ∧ maychange_mem addrs`, both constraints
must hold: registers outside `regs` are unchanged AND memory outside `addrs`
is unchanged.
-/
def maychange_and (f1 f2 : ArmState → ArmState → Prop) :
  ArmState → ArmState → Prop :=
  fun s₁ s₂ => f1 s₁ s₂ ∧ f2 s₁ s₂

## Idempotence of Frame Conditions

A key property for `ensures_trans_simple` is that MAYCHANGE-style frames are
idempotent under relational composition: `C ,, C = C`.

This holds because:
- If only regs R may change from s₀ to s₁, and only R may change from s₁ to s₂
- Then only R may change from s₀ to s₂ (by transitivity of equality on other regs)

`maychange_regs` is idempotent under relational composition.

and only `regs` may change from s2 to s3, then only `regs` may change from s1 to s3.
